# 💼 RAG-Based HR Policy Chatbot

A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that answers HR-related questions using a custom knowledge base and falls back to web search when questions fall outside of the dataset. Built with **Python**, **Streamlit**, **LangChain**, **Groq API**, and **Chroma vector store**.

---

## 📌 Objective

To build a question-answering system that:
- Retrieves relevant HR policy information from a custom knowledge base.
- Uses an LLM to generate human-like responses.
- Falls back to DuckDuckGo web search when the user asks questions unrelated to HR content.

---

## 🔑 Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- [Groq API Key](https://console.groq.com)

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Interactive Streamlit UI** for user-friendly Q&A experience.
- ✅ **Retrieval System**: Embeds HR FAQ chunks using Hugging Face sentence transformers and stores them in Chroma.
- ✅ **RAG Pipeline**: Retrieves top-3 most relevant chunks from the vector store and feeds them to the LLM to generate a context-aware answer.
- ✅ **Agent Logic with LangGraph**:
  - If the query relates to HR, it searches the knowledge base.
  - If not, it routes to DuckDuckGo search.
- ✅ **Web Search Fallback** using DuckDuckGo for out-of-domain queries.
- ✅ **Dynamic Prompting**:
  - If context is missing: "I couldn't find information about this."
  - If LLM says “I don’t know”: Suggests user to rephrase the question.
- ✅ **Lightweight, Local Dataset** (`company_QA.csv`) with HR questions and answers.
- ✅ **Easily Extensible**: Can be modified to work for other domains like movies, recipes, etc.
